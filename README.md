# Rust-jsr-registry

Part of the [teamdunno](https://github.com/teamdunno)'s [`jsr-registry`](https://github.com/search?q=org%3Ateamdunno+jsr-registry&type=repositories) packages

This is the unofficial api wrapper for [JSR](https://jsr.io), a new [npm](https://npmjs.com) like registry owned by [Deno](https://deno.com)

## Installation

Get started by running

```shell
$ cargo add rust-jsr-registry
```

## Example

There's no example for now (since it was'nt stable), you can discover the [docs.rs](https://docs.rs/rust-jsr-registry) for this package

## Note

Every JSR api is allowed for public use, but they **does'nt** document it very well. See https://jsr.io/docs/api
